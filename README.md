Lab 2: Expressions and Interactivity (Irmuun)

Part 1

Result 1: 2 
Because both numbers are declared as integers, thus the output drops the decimal.

Result 2: 2 
Because the remainder is 2, the % symbol divides it but only grabs the remainder.

Result 3: 3.33(3)
Both operands are floats, therefore the output is a float.

Result 4: 6.333(3)
The result will be a float since one of the operands is float, causing the other integers to convert to a float too.

Result 5: 2.4
Here the “static_cast” casts a double, on variable b. So the answer will be a float instead of an integer.
